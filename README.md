This bot is composed of a controller and three modules:

theLeedz_on_X.py -- controller

  trends_handler.py -- calls 3rd party HTTP api to get list of trending topics
                      - packaged as a .zip lambda layer - no dependencies
                      - Environment variables:
                          TRENDS_API = 3rd party API HTTP URL
                                       - https://rapidapi.com/brkygt88/api/twitter-trends5
                                       - free tier --> $2.99 for basically unlimited queries
                          WOEID = used by the API
                          X_KEY = used by the API to get the X trending topics
                          NUM_TRENDS = how many trends to pull --> number of X posts to generate

                      
  gemini_handler.py -- submits structured prompt to Gemini converting topics into statements about the Leedz
                      - built with Docker into a separate lambda, called using invoke(Request_Response)
                      - Environment variables:
                          GOOGLE_API_KEY = Gemini API key

  async_X_handler -- async lambda posts a message to X with a postfix
                      -- built with Docker into a separate lambda, called using invoke(Request_Response)
                      - Environment variables:
                          POSTFIX = signature String appended to each sentence before posting
                          API_KEY = required by X -- must have > minimum level access, Pro or above
                          API_SECRET = provied by X Oauth2
                          ACCESS_TOKEN = provided by X Oauth2
                          ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = provided by X Oauth2
                          WAIT_SEC = handler will wait random number of seconds between 1-->WAIT_SEC before posting

trends_handler
###########################################################

The current trends API returns 50+ trends in a large JSON data structure that also provides context cues and other metadata.  This handler strips out the essential info and distills everything into a numbered list of trending topics.
The length of the list is NUM_TRENDS.

5/21/2024 -- current algorithm does NOT pick top ( NUMTRENDS ) trends returned from API.  It chooses at random ( NUMTRENDS ) number of topics from the entire list of 50+ returned from the API.  
The API only refreshes every 30 minutes, and the top 5 or so trends may be the same hour-to-hour.  This implementation allows the function to be called as 
a standalone in addition to a cron-job and pick fresh topics each call.  This would be a good area to customize for your own needs.

DOES NOT require additional packages
uses http.client.HTTPSConnection to connect to API

  1. put source code in ./python
  2. create trends_handler.zip in ./ 
  3. upload .zip to your controller as a Lambda layer

1. Sign up for a Google Gemini account
2. https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_chat
3. Create a STRUCTURED PROMPT that
    - instructs the AI on the goal -- to turn trends into X posts about the Leedz
    - provides a list of statements about the Leedz to incorporate whole or in part
    - provides a list of SAMPLE request/responses that *I WROTE* to model the output and train the AI
  
Here is the prompt I used:

    prompt_parts = [
      "You are an AI bot who creates posts on X to advertise a business called The Leedz.\nYour input is a list of keywords.\nYou will generate a list of sentences advertising the business containing the keywords.\nEach sentence must be less than 201 characters long.\n\nEach sentence must contain one keyword. \nOnce a keyword has been used, remove it from the list and do not re-use it in another sentence.\nThe first time a keyword is used, preface it with a '#'.\nIf a keyword contains a term in parentheses, use the term for context to clarify the meaning of the keyword. \nFor example,  'Smith (NBA)' indicates that Smith is the name of an NBA player.\nDO NOT include parentheses in the sentence you generate.\n\nTo craft each sentence, use one or more or parts of phrases from About:\nIf a hashtag appears in the About, continue to use it in the output sentence.  \n\nGoals:\n1. Each output sentence should assume that the keyword is true, trending, and important to the reader right now.\n2. Each sentence should promote the Leedz as a business solution to the situation the keyword describes or problem created by the keyword trending now.\n\n\nAbout:\n\n1. theleedz.com is a web app users can access from any browser\n2. The Leedz is a marketplace for #smallbiz vendors to make more money from their booking calendars.\n3. The Leedz solves a problem that every vendor has.  You book a date on your calendar, and afterwards someone else requests your service for the same date. \nThe request has value to another vendor who can take the booking.  Now you can sell it, on the Leedz.\n4. The Leedz enables #smallbusiness owners to make back their advertising money, and grow a network of trusted vendors with whom to trade booking info\n5. The business model of the Leedz is the inverse of #GigSalad, #Thumbtack, #Yelp and other booking providers.  They sell you five gigs for the same date, knowing you can only work one.  Make that money back by selling the other four, on the Leedz.  \n6. #Partyvendors like #inflatables and #facepainters make excellent money on weekends with very low overhead.  These are popular second-jobs, or #sidehustles.\n7. Every day more people are adopting #sidehustles and second jobs to make ends meet in what is called the exploding #gigeconomy\n8. There are over 50 trades on the Leedz from #photobooth vendors, to #caterers, to hair #braiding and #personaltrainers.\n9. The Leedz is built on #serverless #AWS technology and uses #Square to process all payments.  Most #small-business vendors ALREADY use Square to charge sales .  When you sell a leed the money goes directly into your Square account.\n10. The Leedz incorporates industry-standard encryption technology and security protocols to keep your personal and payment data private.",

Find all those vendors and more on the Leedz.\n\nWhile you're watching the #Dembele score a goal in the Champions League, the Leedz is working to sell the bookings you can't work to vendors who can.\n\nTrading #Ethe is a great way to finance your next small-business #sidehustle.  When you are ready to find your first bookings, join the Leedz.\n\nThe stock market is volatile, but #Apple is a safe bet, and so is The Leedz. \n\nWith news of the #Boeing Whistleblower Death and other corporate politics, people are turning to more secure, reliable home businesses.

  The Docker build process is difficult.  These are the commands I use on Windows, in Powershell, to build an deploy this and other Lambdas to AWS in region us-west-2:
  1. Start Docker Dekstop
  
  $ aws ecr get-login-password --region <YOUR AWS REGION> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <YOUR PID>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
  $ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name gemini_handler --region us-west-2 --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --image-tag-mutability MUTABLE
  $ docker build  --platform linux/x86_64 -t <YOUR PID>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gemini_handler:latest --no-cache .
  $ docker push <YOUR PID>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gemini_handler:latest
  $ aws lambda update-function-code --function-name  arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:<YOUR PID>:function:gemini_handler --image-uri <YOUR PID>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gemini_handler:latest
